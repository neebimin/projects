    "After studying the posts, there seems to be no clear trend. That said, there are some that could have just posted in the subreddit while showing mild symptoms of depression, rather than being in a more 'advanced' stage of depression that could potentially be a suicide case. Besides, different people express themselves differently and what could have been a genuine cry for help such as 'could use someone to talk to' might not have been phrased the same way by others having the same suicidal thoughts. There is definitely a need for more data for the model to be able to pick up the minor differences in how people express themselves. "

    "**Production Model**\n",

    "As mentioned above, the production model would be **Tfidf Vectorization with Multinomial Naive Bayes**, which gave a rather high recall rate of 81% - the fraction of the total amount of suicidal instances that were actually retrieved by the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to recognise the limitations of using posts or written notes of any kind to raise red flags about potential suicide cases. The written notes cannot capture the tone in which it is written and cannot capture a person's behavioural changes which usually serves as a telltale sign. Thus, while it can be useful as a form of first screening, there is also a need to examine behavioural changes in relationships, eating and sleeping habits, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Further Expansion**\n",
    "\n",
    "The two subreddits used are depression and suicide, which means that it could fail to classify those who are suicidal and at the same time, face depression correctly. The project could benefit from widening the scope of data collection to include people who may be suicidal due to other conditions like trauma and anxiety. \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides, higher data granularity, such as location, age, and gender would probably help in classifying because people from different regions, genders and age would express themselves differently. This will help identify the nuances and classify the categories better. The project can also be generalised to include more stakeholders such as parents, the community and teachers to help identify suicidal patients early on. It will be particularly helpful for those who do not have background in the field, i.e. those who are not trained psychologists and psychiatrists. "
